# API-GRAPH

Helicarrier [Engineering Challenge](https://helicarrier.notion.site/Engineering-Challenge-f870aea032e14381ae4e404263534326)

### Tech Stack

1. Typescript
2. ReactJS
3. GraphQL
4. Apollo Client
5. Prisma ORM
6. Postgres Database
7. Material-UI

### Description and Features

A scrollable interface with datasets grouped by date. Datasets can be filtered by certain values or can be searched through by text strings.

#### Dataset Structure

The Dataset is a sampled array of transactions with the following fields

```ts
interface Action {
  id: number;
  ref: string;
  trxn: string;
  type: string;
  status: string;
  party: string;
  amount: string;
  narrative: string;
  logId: number;
}

interface Log {
  id: number;
  date: string;
  actions: Action[];
}
```

#### Filter Values

There are two groups of filter values. Filter can be a single value or combination of one value from each group. In the UI, the filter group is a horizontal list of scrollable items.

| Status  |   Type   |
| :-----: | :------: |
| Success |  Credit  |
| Failed  |  Debit   |
| Pending | Reversal |

#### Search Queries

Search queries can be run on the following fields

1. Ref
2. Trxn
3. Party
4. Amount
5. Narrative

Results will return all transactions with any field matching

### Development Journey

I started with sampling data using FakerJS and setting up GraphQL backend. ReactJS was prefered for frontend majorly because it requires less setup and development bugs. I added Jest tests initially but had to drop it and focus more on meeting the stated requirements.

I had to decide between Sequelize and Prisma for object-relational mapping. Sequelize is quite matured compared to Prisma, but I love the fact that Prisma offers more flexibilities and even works with NoSQL databses perfectly, plus they have great documentation and community support. And for Database, there were no two thoughts about Postgres

Challenges!
Working on this app has been moderately challenging. But for the funny part, I got stuck trying to fix an 'error' reported by Typscript for hours... only to realise that I had the file extension as `.ts` instead of `.tsx`. I can guess your face right now will be just like mine ðŸ™„. Well, I solved that thanks to a bowl-full of Waakye ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

### Clone and Setup

#### Prerequisites

1. Install NodeJS on your system
2. Install Yarn Package Manager
3. Install Postgres for your system
4. Git (optional)

#### Steps

1. [Download the source](https://github.com/moses-20/apigraph/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the zip file or clone by running `git clone https://github.com/moses-20/apigraph.git`
2. Open up the folder with your editor
3. Open the terminal with the folder as the working directory
4. Run `cd client` and `yarn install`
5. After that, change into the server folder `cd ../server` and run `yarn install`
6. Create `.env` file in the root of ther server folder and add a postgres database url like so `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/DATABASE`. Replace USERNAME, PASSWORD, SERVER, PORT and DATABASE accordingly
7. Seed the Database by running `yarn prisma migrate dev --name init`
8. Start the server with `yarn dev`
9. Open another terminal and change into the client folder.
10. Run `yarn start` to start the frontend
11. You can import the `apigraph.postman_collection.json` file into postman and run the GraphQL queries
12. If you use VS Code, you can install ThunderClient extension and run the GraphQL queries
13. Feedbacks and comments are welcome
